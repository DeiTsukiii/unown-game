# 📜 Unown Game — In Development

This is a **fan-made Pokémon game** currently being developed using **Phaser 3**.

Although this project is quite ambitious and might never be fully finished, here’s a basic playable version to explore the core ideas.

The game follows a young trainer’s journey through a mysterious new region, where the enigmatic Zarbi Pokémon hold a secret. A shadowy organization is trying to uncover this secret, pushing you to explore ancient ruins, solve puzzles, and face many foes along the way.

Gameplay stays true to classic Pokémon titles, featuring battles, arenas, badge collection, and Pokémon League challenges. Exploration and discovery drive the adventure, with the story unfolding as you progress.
